						<dt>VI</dt>
						<dd>As a child, he loses his parents to the executioners in the war between Piltover and the Underground City and is orphaned with his younger brother Powder, so he takes extra care of his younger brother. However, what his beloved brother did for him and what he did eventually killed his brothers and friends who grew up together from childhood, and even killed his father, Vander.[18] Due to this incident, he impulsively beat his younger brother and said harsh words, which caused an indelible wound to his younger brother, and left the misunderstanding that he abandoned his younger brother because of a twist.</dd>

						<dt>JINX</dt>
						<dd>Her real name is Powder. Appears as one of four children in the neighborhood who go to Piltover to steal. He lost his parents to Piltover when he was young and is making a living by committing miscellaneous crimes with his older sister, Bai. Because he is the youngest among his peers, he only gets in the way, so he is nicknamed “Jinx” in the sense that “the crime of taking the powder out doesn’t work.” It's no wonder she was bullied, but her older sister Bai always covered and defended the powder, so she didn't get any harm other than Milo's complaints.</dd>

						<dt>ECO</dt>
						<dd>I've been hanging out with Bai's party since I was a kid, and it seems that I was very close with Jinx, who is a similar age group among them. He rescues Bai's group from being chased by the Piltover police. Subsequent tales reveal that he was responsible for giving Powder information about a well-stocked penthouse room in Piltover. It is said that the information was eavesdropped from a person who bought a lot of parts without asking the price at Benzo's shop.[3] However, after that, Benzo was torn to death by Silco and the monster he created with drugs, and in the meantime, it is estimated that he has a fairly strong mentality</dd>
